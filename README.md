# Text Summarization
This code summarises a paragraph into few lines using extraction based method. This code was written during my participation in Reliance Hackathon.

Page ranking algorithm was used to rank each sentence in a paragraph, based on which the summay was generated.

RUN

$ python TextSummarizExt.py

Note: Copy the Report_1.txt file in the same directory as the python file.
